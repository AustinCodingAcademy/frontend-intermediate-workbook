//1. What is a data type that can have only the values true or false? Provide an example.

//Answer: boolean




//2. What is a null value? Provide one example.

//Answer: essentially a place holder. You assign it to something you know will need a value later




//3. List and describe 3 more data types used in JS.

//Answer: strings, numbers, and booleans. Strings are surrounded by quotes making them essentially not able to have any value just what the string states. Numbers are just that numbers and they actually have value (see string of "3" vs number 3). Booleans are either just true or false


//4. Why do we use comments in JS?

//Answer: so both us and others reading it have a better understanding of that is going on. It can also be used for testing to remove a section of code.


//5. Why do we use 'strict mode'?

//Answer: *IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD GO OVER THIS A LITTLE MORE* from what i understand it gives us more options as developers.


//6. Write the code to log the output "Hello World".

//Answer: console.log("Hello World");


//7. What is the difference between the "and" and the "or" operators? Explain why you would use each of them.

//Answer: and && is when you want two things to the be same. You could use them if you want two things BOTH to be true or one of two things to be true


//8. Explain truthiness and falsiness in your own words. Provide an example for each.

//Answer: anything that evaulates to true or an actual value evaluates to true and false is the opposite except in the area of numbers if it evaulates to 0 it is also false.



//The following is an example of what the next few questions will look like:

//Will the follow lines of code print out true or false?
//console.log(true && true);

//Answer: true


//9. console.log(true && false);

//Answer: false




//10. console.log(false && true);

//Answer: false




//11. console.log(true && true && false);

//Answer:false




//12. console.log(true || false);

//Answer: true




//13. console.log(false || true);

//Answer: true




//14. console.log(true || true || false);

//Answer: true




//15. console.log(!true);

//Answer: false




//16. console.log(!undefined);

//Answer: true




//17. console.log(!!"Hello");

//Answer: true




//18. console.log(!!null);

//Answer: false




//19. var x = 7;
//    var y = 5;

//    console.log(x !== y);

//Answer: true




//20. What’s the difference between == and ===?

//Answer: == evauatles the state of the comparison (not sue how to word that). and === needs to be an exact answer




//21. What’s the difference between != and !==?

//Answer: the same as the answer before but saying "not" in front of it?




//22. What does (7 - 4 && 6 + 3) || (7 < 5 || 8 > 4) evaluate to? Explain how you solved your answer.

//Answer: i don't think I get this.... PEMDAS would say (3 &&[meaning both are true] 9 ) || (false ||[either is true] true)
// so either it will be both 3 and 9, 3 and 9 and true, or because 9 falls in the same spot at true it will be just 9. I'm leaning toward just 9 because I don't think in this since it can return more than one answer, but don't know the correct solution.
