//what can I do as an adult


// i want to print out ALL the things i can do when i am a certain age
//whats wrong with this code from a logic standpoint
var age = 66;
if(age >  16)
{
    console.log("i can drive");
}
else if( age > 18)
{
    console.log("i can vote");
}
else{
    console.log("i am too young to do anything");
}



//whats wrong here
if(age > 65)
{
    console.log('you must retire');
}

if(age > 18)
{
    console.log('you must continue working');
}























//1)Not mututally exclusive,  i can drive and vote, but if i use else if, only one of those things is possible. You don't have to use else if or else all the time
