# The Towers Of Hanoi
## Overview:
###### Towers of Hanoi is a simple logic game involving three stacks. The first stack has four (or more) blocks, each one bigger than the next, stacked like a pyramid. The point of the game is to move the blocks from one stack and arrange them in the same order into another stack, but never placing a larger block onto a smaller block. You can play the game here to get an idea.

## Checklist:
## Code Plan
1. Get user input (startStack, endstack) and then check the rules of the game based on the current stack object
2. Whenever we want to move a number, we need to check that number and make sure that it is less than the number you are trying to place it on
