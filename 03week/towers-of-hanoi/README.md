# The Towers Of Hanoi
## Overview:
###### Towers of Hanoi is a simple logic game involving three stacks. The first stack has four (or more) blocks, each one bigger than the next, stacked like a pyramid. The point of the game is to move the blocks from one stack and arrange them in the same order into another stack, but never placing a larger block onto a smaller block. You can play the game here to get an idea.
