# Week 6 Day 1 Discussion Questions

* What is Big O Notation?

    * Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

* How would you, in general terms, describe dynamic programming?

    * Dynamic programming is when you use past knowledge to make solving a future problem easier.

    * Dynamic programming is a technique used to avoid computing multiple time the same subproblem in a recursive algorithm.

* Why do we use algorithms?

    * Algorithms are the building blocks of computer programs.

    * To tell a computer what to do in a step-by-step way.
