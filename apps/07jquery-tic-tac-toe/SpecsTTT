Tic Tac Toe - jQuery

***Spec 1***

        Set a variable playerTurn equal to 'X'.
        
        Using jQuery, set a click listener on all of the [data-cell]s that SETs playerTurn as .text() on $(this) by $(this).text(playerTurn).

***Spec 2***

        Also in your click event, toggle playerTurn between 'O' and 'X' using a ternary operator.
        You should now be able to change turns as you click around on your board.

***Spec 3***

        Write a function checkForWin() that checks each combination of winning data-cells and see if they all contain the current playerTurn.

        Remember to use .text() to GET the text content of any data-cell. If so, select '#announce-winner' and SET its .text() to say 'Player ' + playerTurn + 'Wins!'.

        Run this function every time a player makes a mark, but before the playerTurn switches.

***Spec 4***

        Add a button with an id="clear" that will not only clear the board, but reset the player to player 'X'.


***Bonus Spec***

        Protect against changing a previously marked cell.
